# 🚀 Performance Optimization Plan - Cognition App

## 📊 Current Performance Issues

### Critical Problems Identified:
- **Profile Loading**: Still 7 seconds (should be <1s)
- **Voting Operations**: 15+ seconds (should be <1s) 
- **AI History Popups**: Not showing despite being enabled
- **Thread Loading**: Slow and inconsistent
- **General UX**: Multiple small bugs causing poor user experience

### Root Cause Analysis:
1. **Database Inefficiencies**: Missing indexes, expensive queries, N+1 problems
2. **API Route Bottlenecks**: Sequential queries, duplicate operations, poor caching
3. **Frontend Issues**: Unnecessary re-renders, missing loading states, broken components
4. **Infrastructure Problems**: Connection pooling, timeout issues, network latency

## 🎯 Systematic Performance Audit Strategy

### Phase 1: Performance Profiling & Measurement (IMMEDIATE)

**1.1 Add Comprehensive Monitoring**
- [ ] Add `console.time()` markers to all API routes
- [ ] Add Server-Timing headers for backend vs frontend analysis
- [ ] Enable Prisma query logging with execution times
- [ ] Add performance tracking to React components

**1.2 Automated Performance Analysis**
- [ ] Use `pg_stat_statements` to identify slowest database queries
- [ ] Run `EXPLAIN ANALYZE` on all critical queries
- [ ] Use Next.js bundle analyzer to find bloated imports
- [ ] Profile React components with React DevTools Profiler

### Phase 2: Database Performance Deep Dive

**2.1 Query Optimization**
- [ ] Audit all API routes for missing indexes
- [ ] Find and fix N+1 query patterns
- [ ] Eliminate expensive `_count` operations
- [ ] Add composite indexes for common query patterns

**2.2 Schema Optimization**
- [ ] Add denormalized counters (upvoteCount, followerCount, threadCount)
- [ ] Review foreign key relationships and constraints
- [ ] Consider materialized views for expensive aggregations
- [ ] Optimize connection pooling settings

### Phase 3: API Route Systematic Review

**3.1 Route Performance Audit**
- [ ] Profile `/api/users/[id]` (7s profile loading)
- [ ] Profile `/api/threads/[id]/vote` (15s voting)
- [ ] Profile `/api/threads` (slow thread loading)
- [ ] Profile `/api/notifications` (potential bottleneck)
- [ ] Profile all other routes systematically

**3.2 Query Pattern Fixes**
- [ ] Convert sequential queries to parallel Promise.all()
- [ ] Eliminate duplicate Supabase auth calls
- [ ] Add comprehensive response caching
- [ ] Optimize data selection (avoid SELECT *)

### Phase 4: Frontend Performance Issues

**4.1 React Component Optimization**
- [ ] Find and fix unnecessary re-renders
- [ ] Add missing useMemo/useCallback optimizations
- [ ] Fix AI loading modal triggers
- [ ] Optimize component tree structure

**4.2 Data Fetching Optimization**
- [ ] Convert heavy pages to React Server Components
- [ ] Eliminate client-side waterfall requests
- [ ] Add proper loading states everywhere
- [ ] Implement optimistic UI updates

### Phase 5: Infrastructure & Caching

**5.1 Caching Strategy**
- [ ] Add comprehensive HTTP cache headers
- [ ] Implement Redis/memory caching for hot data
- [ ] Add CDN for static assets
- [ ] Cache expensive computations

**5.2 Connection & Network Optimization**
- [ ] Optimize Prisma connection pooling
- [ ] Review Supabase connection settings
- [ ] Add connection retry logic
- [ ] Optimize bundle sizes and code splitting

## 🛠️ Implementation Strategy

### Approach: Hybrid Analysis + Targeted Fixes

**Step 1: Automated Bottleneck Identification (30 mins)**
- Add comprehensive logging to identify worst offenders
- Use database query analysis tools
- Profile frontend components

**Step 2: Fix Critical Path Issues (2-4 hours)**
- Target the 3-5 worst performance bottlenecks
- Focus on issues causing 7s+ delays
- Prioritize user-facing operations (profile, voting, loading)

**Step 3: Systematic Optimization (1-2 days)**
- Work through each API route methodically
- Add proper indexes and optimize queries
- Convert to Server Components where beneficial
- Implement comprehensive caching

**Step 4: Performance Verification (ongoing)**
- Add performance monitoring dashboard
- Set up automated performance testing
- Monitor real-world metrics
