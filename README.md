# üß† Vanwinkle

> **A collaborative platform for sharing, building upon, and evolving AI conversations**

Vanwinkle transforms private AI chats into a living, collaborative knowledge base where users can share their conversations with AI assistants, contribute new insights, and collectively build upon each other's discoveries.

## üéØ Vision

Instead of AI conversations disappearing into private chat histories, Vanwinkle creates a **social layer for AI interaction** where:

- **Knowledge compounds** through community contributions
- **Conversations evolve** beyond their original scope  
- **Insights are preserved** and made discoverable
- **Collective intelligence** emerges from individual AI interactions

## ‚ú® How It Works

2. **AI automatically generates** an engaging summary using our platform's API
3. **Add tags and source labels** for discoverability
4. **Publish to the community** for others to discover

- **Read full conversations** with chat-like formatting
- **Find insights** from diverse AI interactions across the community

### ü§ù **Contribute & Collaborate**
- **Select any text** from a conversation to reply to specific points
- **Continue with AI** using your own API key for targeted responses
- **Add manual insights** with your own analysis or follow-up questions
- **Build conversation chains** that evolve ideas beyond the original scope

### üì§ **Export & Reuse**
- **Export complete conversations** including all contributions
- **Take enhanced discussions** to your private AI sessions
- **Build upon community insights** in your own projects

## üîñ **ChatGPT Bookmarklet Magic**

Our intelligent bookmarklet makes sharing ChatGPT conversations effortless:

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+ 
- PostgreSQL database (Supabase recommended)
- At least one AI API key (OpenAI, Anthropic, or Google AI)
- GitHub OAuth app (for authentication)
- Email service setup in Supabase (for email auth)

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Regional Considerations

**Database Location & Performance:**
- The current setup uses Supabase hosted in **Singapore (AWS ap-southeast-1)**
- **Local users (Asia-Pacific)**: Optimal performance with low latency
- **International users (USA, Europe)**: May experience slower load times (~200-300ms latency)
- **During travel**: Temporary connectivity issues may occur due to changing networks

**Known Issues & Solutions:**
- **Intermittent connectivity**: Restart your Supabase instance if you experience 500 errors while traveling
- **Regional latency**: For production deployment with global users, consider multi-region database setup
- **Network sensitivity**: Hotel/airport WiFi may cause temporary connection issues

**For Production Scaling:**
- Consider Supabase read replicas in user regions (USA, Europe)
- Implement connection retry logic for mobile/unstable connections
- Monitor user feedback for regional performance issues

### Environment Setup

Create a `.env` file with:

```bash
# Database
DATABASE_URL="postgresql://..."
DIRECT_URL="postgresql://..."

# Supabase
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL="https://your-project.supabase.co"
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY="your-anon-key"

# AI APIs (Platform-level for summaries/titles)
OPENAI_API_KEY="sk-..."
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY="sk-ant-..."
GOOGLE_API_KEY="AI..."
PLATFORM_AI_PROVIDER="openai"  # or "anthropic" or "google"
SUMMARY_MODEL="gpt-4o-mini"

# Security
API_KEY_ENCRYPTION_KEY="your-32-character-encryption-key"
NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL="http://localhost:3000"
```

### AI-Enhanced
The platform uses AI not just as content, but as a **collaborative tool** to help users contribute more effectively.

### Privacy-Conscious  
Users control what they share, and **anonymous browsing** is always available for discovery.

### Quality-Focused
Features like **invite-only signup** and **waitlist management** ensure the community maintains high engagement and quality.
