> **A collaborative platform for sharing, building upon, and evolving AI conversations**

vanwinkle transforms private AI chats into a living, collaborative knowledge base where users can share their conversations with AI assistants, contribute new insights, and collectively build upon each other's discoveries.

## üéØ Vision

Instead of AI conversations disappearing into private chat histories, vanwinkle creates a **social layer for AI interaction** where:

- **Knowledge compounds** through community contributions
- **Conversations evolve** beyond their original scope  
- **Insights are preserved** and made discoverable
- **Collective intelligence** emerges from individual AI interactions

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+ 
- PostgreSQL database (Supabase recommended)
- At least one AI API key (OpenAI, Anthropic, or Google AI)
- GitHub OAuth app (for authentication)
- Email service setup in Supabase (for email auth)

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Production Deployment & Database Configuration

**Database Connection Setup:**
- Uses **Supabase PostgreSQL** with connection pooling for optimal performance
- **Prisma ORM** configured with singleton client pattern to prevent connection conflicts
- **Transaction mode** enabled for serverless compatibility

**Critical Production Settings:**
- **DATABASE_URL** must include `?pgbouncer=true&connection_limit=1` for Vercel deployment
- **Shared Prisma Client** prevents "prepared statement already exists" errors in serverless
- **Connection resilience** configured for regional connectivity variations

**Regional Considerations:**
- Current setup uses Supabase hosted in **Singapore (AWS ap-southeast-1)**
- **Asia-Pacific users**: Optimal performance with low latency
- **International users**: May experience ~200-300ms latency but stable connectivity
- **Production-tested** across multiple regions with robust error handling

**Troubleshooting Production Issues:**
- **500 errors on API endpoints**: Usually resolved by database restart + proper connection string format
- **Prepared statement conflicts**: Fixed by singleton Prisma client and transaction mode
- **Authentication failures**: Ensure Supabase RLS policies are properly configured
- **Regional connectivity**: Connection pooling and retry logic handle temporary network issues

**For Production Scaling:**
- Consider Supabase read replicas for global distribution
- Monitor connection pool usage in Vercel analytics
- Implement health checks for database connectivity

### Environment Setup

Create a `.env` file with:

```bash
# Database (Critical: Include pgbouncer parameters for production)
DATABASE_URL="postgresql://user:password@host:port/db?pgbouncer=true&connection_limit=1"
DIRECT_URL="postgresql://user:password@host:port/db?sslmode=require"

# Database connection settings for better regional connectivity
DATABASE_CONNECTION_LIMIT=5
DATABASE_POOL_TIMEOUT=10
DATABASE_CONNECT_TIMEOUT=60

# Supabase
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL="https://your-project.supabase.co"
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY="your-anon-key"

# AI APIs (Platform-level for summaries/titles)
OPENAI_API_KEY="sk-..."
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY="sk-ant-..."
GOOGLE_API_KEY="AI..."
PLATFORM_AI_PROVIDER="openai"  # or "anthropic" or "google"
SUMMARY_MODEL="gpt-4o-mini"

# Security
API_KEY_ENCRYPTION_KEY="your-32-character-encryption-key"
NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL="http://localhost:3000"
```

## üîí User API Keys: Security Overview

- **Encryption at rest**: User-supplied provider keys are encrypted using `AES-256-CBC` with a fresh per-record IV. The 32-byte cipher key is derived from `API_KEY_ENCRYPTION_KEY` via `scrypt`.
- **Server-only decryption**: Keys are decrypted in memory on the server only when needed to call provider APIs; plaintext is never persisted or logged.
- **AuthN/Z**: Management routes require an authenticated Supabase session; users can only manage their own keys.
- **Validation & hygiene**: Keys are cleaned (whitespace/invisible chars removed) and validated per provider format before storage.
- **Fields**: Encrypted keys are stored on `User` as `encryptedOpenAIKey`, `encryptedAnthropicKey`, `encryptedGoogleKey`.

See `docs/api-keys-security.md` for hardening recommendations (rotation, audit logs, rate limiting, log redaction) and implementation checklist.

### AI-Enhanced
The platform uses AI not just as content, but as a **collaborative tool** to help users contribute more effectively.

### Privacy-Conscious  
Users control what they share, and **anonymous browsing** is always available for discovery.

### Quality-Focused
Features like **invite-only signup** and **waitlist management** ensure the community maintains high engagement and quality.
